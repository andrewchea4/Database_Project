The workload specifies skew at the tuple level for three of the relations

Stock relation: The stock level for each item at each warehouse is maintained
Order relation: A permanent record of each order is maintained
New-Order relation: pending orders are maintained and later deleted by a Delivery transaction
Order-Line relation: An entry is made for each item ordered.

New Order transaction: Places an order for on average 10 items from a warehouse, insert the order, and for each item updates the corresponding stock level.
Payment transaction: Process a payment for a customer and updates balances and other data in the Warehouse, District and Customer relations.
Order status relation: Returns the status of a customer's last order. (고객의 주문이 어떻게 처리되고 있는지 상태 확인을 처리하는 비지니스 트랜젝션)
Delivery transaction: Processes orders corresponding to 10 pending orders, one for each district, with 10 items per order.
Stock level transaction: Examines the quantity of stock for the itmes ordered by each of the last 20 orders in a district.

Tuples accessed by the Order-status, Delivery, and Stock-Level transactions are more likely to be buffer pool hits since they are for tuples that have been recently put in the buffer pool
by the New-Order transaction

TPC-C benchmark assumes access to the tuples are skewed, within a relation some tuples are referenced more frequently than others.
