Space amplification : The ratio of the size of the database to the size of the data in the database
Compression decreases space amplification. It is increased by fragmentatino with a B-Tree and old versions of rows with an LSM

Write amplification : phenomenon that occurs in flash memory and SSDs in which the amount of data written to your memory device is greater thatn the amount of information that you 
are actually trying to store.

SSDs don't have mechanical erros, so it is reliable that HDDs. However, they do have a finite lifespan. 
The lifespan of an SSD, and that of any kind of flash memory, is a function of how many program and erase cycels it can perform.
Thus, write amplification can have a dramatic impact on the overall longevity of a storage device.

-------- Why does write amplification occur ---------
In, HDDs, new data can be written on top of existing data => SSD, existing data has to be erased to make room for new data. The erase porcess that occurs has a major role in write amplification
